# Network Enumeration & Service Exploitation  

## Overview  
This repository focuses on learning how to connect to various network services anonymously and use **Nmap** to identify open ports on a target system.  
We will explore the following services:  

- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol)  
- **SMB** (Server Message Block)  
- **Telnet**  
- **Rsync**
